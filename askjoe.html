<p>1. How can I prevent my pipes from freezing?</p>
<p>2. If my pipes burst, what should I do to stop the flooding?</p>
<p>3. My washing machine smells like a sewer, what can I do?</p>
<p>4. What size air conditioner do I need?</p>
<p>5. My hot water keeps running out. Do I need a larger water heater?</p>
<br>
A1: Begin by insulating the pipes that are located on outside walls. And, if you have had previous problems with a freezing, leave a faucet trickling hot water.
<br>

<br>

<br>
